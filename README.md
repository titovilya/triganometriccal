# Triganomic calculator for simple eqution

I`m the first-year student. It`s my second program.

Works only for simple trigonometric expressions
Not a single library used!

The program can process all trigonometric equations
Extra spaces at the end are forbidden. Will be considered an incorrect entry.
Equations should fit the standard. cos(x) + sin^2(t) = y
Where under t and x can be 1x/3, 412x/5, x. Moreover, x is mandatory before division
Under y can be sqrt(2), sqrt(5)/3,24123 and all kinds of numbers
Instead of cosine and sine, you can also use all tangent and cotangent
However, I could not write an algorithm to solve any addition, multiplication
The program will give an answer only for simple trigonometric expressions of the form:
           cos(12x) = 1
           sin(3x/4) = 1/2
           ctg(50x/21) = sqrt(3/3)
           tg(x) = sqrt(2)/2


Divides the input expression into 2 parts. Separator is equal.
The input entered by the user goes to the input
At the output of 2 lists: before and after. In addition, each element is separate.
At the same time, we discard part of the errors.
